		description: 'TM Network Inc. started with EasyEats, a mobile nutrition platform created to help people achieve their health and fitness goals through personalized diets and gamified accountability. While developing EasyEats, my cofounder and I realized that even with positive UI feedback, we hadn\'t truly validated whether we were solving a pressing problem for our users. This experience taught us the value of deep customer understanding and led us to pivot toward a mission closer to our own experiences: helping university students study more effectively, particularly in courses where practice materials are limited and difficult to find.\n\nWith this new direction, we began by interviewing nearly 100 UBC students to understand their pain points and validate assumptions about their study needs. Recognizing that professors are key players in the learning process, we are also conducting interviews with faculty to explore how they might integrate with our solution and support student success.\n\nAs founder and CTO, I lead both the business and development sides of TM Network:\n\nCustomer Discovery & Business Strategy: Conduct interviews with students and professors to validate assumptions, identify pain points, and refine our business model. Collaborate with my cofounder to adjust the company direction based on these insights.\n\nProduct Design & Development: Design solutions to address validated student problems and lead full-stack development from concept to deployment. Previously developed EasyEats with React Native, Express, Firebase, and Stripe, deploying multiple beta versions to TestFlight and Google Play.',
